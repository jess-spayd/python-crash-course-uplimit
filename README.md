### Uplimit Python Crash Course
**January - February 2024**

I won a scholarship from Women Who Code to take Uplimit's Python Crash Course. In this repository, you can check out the projects I completed for the course.
- My [Project 1: The Decision Maker](https://github.com/jess-spayd/python-crash-course-uplimit/blob/main/Project_1_The_Decision_Maker.ipynb) leveraged functions, logical expressions, and conditional statements to construct a tool that assists the user in deciding whether a candidate for a job is qualified or highly qualified.
- In [Project 2: Photo Filters](https://github.com/jess-spayd/python-crash-course-uplimit/blob/main/Project_2_Photo_Filters.ipynb), I used for-loops on nested lists to mutate the pixels of a (very cute) photo and generate discolored, inverted, rotated, flipped, and grayscale versions of the photo.
- For [Project 3: Text Generator](https://github.com/jess-spayd/python-crash-course-uplimit/blob/main/Jess_Spayd_Project_3_Text_Generator.ipynb), I sliced Emily Dickinson's poetry into dictionaries to create an Emily Dickinson-style poem generator using a Markov chain.
